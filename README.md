# EU4-Idea-Group-Evaluator


EU4 Idea evaluator. Evaluations are designed for semi-competitive multiplayer play. This list is very incorrect for singleplayer or WC.
Values for the modifiers are stored in the .py file, although such values can easily be pulled from a .txt file.
Make sure there are no trailing zeros for the idea names. The EU4 idea .txt in both vanilla and Anbennar (and probably others) are inconsistent with this.
Several mods, like Imperium Universalis, rename such ideas to things like "skirmisher_power = x.yz". No non-vanilla ideas are referenced, so these must be added.
I almost certainly missed some of the lesser ideas; add them if you wish.
